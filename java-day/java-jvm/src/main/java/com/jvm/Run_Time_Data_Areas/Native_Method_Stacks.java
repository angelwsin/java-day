//    An implementation of the Java Virtual Machine may use conventional stacks,
//    colloquially called "C stacks," to support native methods (methods written in a
//    language other than the Java programming language). Native method stacks may
//    also be used by the implementation of an interpreter for the Java Virtual Machine's
//    instruction set in a language such as C. Java Virtual Machine implementations
//    that cannot load native methods and that do not themselves rely on conventional
//
//    stacks need not supply native method stacks. If supplied, native method stacks are
//    typically allocated per thread when each thread is created.
