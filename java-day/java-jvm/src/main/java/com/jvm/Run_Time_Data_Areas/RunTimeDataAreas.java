    The Java Virtual Machine defines various run-time data areas that are used during
    execution of a program. Some of these data areas are created on Java Virtual
    Machine start-up and are destroyed only when the Java Virtual Machine exits.
    Other data areas are per thread. Per-thread data areas are created when a thread is
    created and destroyed when the thread exits.*/
