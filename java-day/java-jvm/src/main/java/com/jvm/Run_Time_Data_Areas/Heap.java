   /* The Java Virtual Machine has a heap that is shared among all Java Virtual Machine
    threads. The heap is the run-time data area from which memory for all class
    instances and arrays is allocated.
    The heap is created on virtual machine start-up. Heap storage for objects is
    reclaimed by an automatic storage management system (known as a garbage
    collector); objects are never explicitly deallocated. The Java Virtual Machine
    assumes no particular type of automatic storage management system, and the
    storage management technique may be chosen according to the implementor's
    system requirements. The heap may be of a fixed size or may be expanded as
    required by the computation and may be contracted if a larger heap becomes
    unnecessary. The memory for the heap does not need to be contiguous.*/
