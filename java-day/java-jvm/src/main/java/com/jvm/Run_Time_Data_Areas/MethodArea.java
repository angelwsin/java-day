        of the constant_pool table in a class file (ยง4.4). It contains several kinds of
        constants, ranging from numeric literals known at compile-time to method and field
        references that must be resolved at run-time. The run-time constant pool serves a
        function similar to that of a symbol table for a conventional programming language,
        although it contains a wider range of data than a typical symbol table.
        Each run-time constant pool is allocated from the Java Virtual Machine's method
        area (ยง2.5.4). The run-time constant pool for a class or interface is constructed
        when the class or interface is created (ยง5.3) by the Java Virtual Machine
