     * 1.Build plugins will be executed during the build and they should be configured in the <build/> element from the POM
     * 
     * 2.Reporting plugins will be executed during the site generation and they should be configured in the <reporting/> element from the POM
     * 
     * 
     * All plugins should have minimal required informations: groupId, artifactId and version.
